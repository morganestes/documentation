## Platform Improvements

### Drupal 9.2.6

[Drupal 9.2.6](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/9.2.6) is now available for production sites. [Drupal 9](/drupal-9) sites on Pantheon use [Integrated Composer](/guides/integrated-composer), enabling one-click core updates through the Dashboard. To check for available updates, click **Check Now** from the Site Dashboard **Dev** tab.

Drupal 9.2.x will receive security coverage until June 15, 2022. Sites on 9.1.x or earlier should update to [Drupal 9.1.13](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/9.1.11).


### Drupal 8.9.19

[Drupal 8.9.19](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.9.19) is now available on the Pantheon platform. Detailed information on applying and debugging core updates can be found in the [Core Updates documentation](/core-updates).


### WordPress 5.8.1

[WordPress 5.8.1](https://wordpress.org/news/2021/09/wordpress-5-8-1-security-and-maintenance-release/) is a short-cycle security and maintenance release that is currently available on the Pantheon platform. The next major WordPress release will be version [5.9](https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-9/). Detailed information on applying and debugging core updates can be found in the [Core Updates documentation](/core-updates).


## Documentation

[Autopilot](/guides/autopilot) - The Autopilot updater bot now scans a site’s homepage when initially enabled and automatically suggests 10 links that are important for VRT, allowing users to enable it for large site portfolios without having to manually create a test plan. You can also use the CMS update automation tool in the Dashboard to determine the estimated time your team has saved in Autopilot. For more information, refer to our [Autopilot documentation](https://pantheon.io/docs/guides/autopilot/enable-autopilot/#enable-autopilot).

[Pantheon Global CDN](https://pantheon.io/docs/global-cdn) - The Global CDN now offers Experience Protection to provide continuous and uninterrupted site uptime. If your site experiences issues, whether it’s an infrastructure problem or an application error, the Global CDN now delivers cached content to visitors instead of displaying an error message. For more information, refer to our [Experience Protection documentation](https://pantheon.io/docs/global-cdn#experience-protection). 

[Terminus](https://pantheon.io/docs/terminus/updates) - The default branch name of the Terminus GitHub repository has changed from `master` to `2.x`. This change only impacts individuals with a local clone of the Terminus repository, such as Terminus contributors or plugin developers. Update the local clone of the branch to `2.x` as described in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-branches-in-your-repository/renaming-a-branch#updating-a-local-clone-after-a-branch-name-changes) to avoid disruptions.
